# Contributing

We do not accept direct commits to this repository, please use forks to make a
contribution.

## Epic contributions

If your work is under an epic like `epic/nuxt-3`, then you are making an epic
contribution.

Epics are created under `mouseless` in `epic/*` branches and these branches are
protected. So to make a contribution create an issue branch in
`issue/{epic-name}/{issue-name}` format on your fork, and create a pull request
to `mouseless:epic/{epic-name}` branch __not__ to `mouseless:main` branch.

After all work is done, epics will merge to main branch directly in original
repository.

## Other contributions

If your work is independent from an epic, then create a branch in
`issue/{issue-name}` format and create a pull request directly from this branch
to `mouseless:main` branch.
